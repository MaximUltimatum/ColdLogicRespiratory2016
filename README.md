# ColdLogicRespiratory2016
This is the Repository (Yes, we know we spelled that wrong) for Team 3617 Cold Logic, which we will use to share the responsibility oc building code for Sir Kit among mrkwanza, thayeryates, and MaximUltimatum. Supervisors mcder017 and gappleto97 will watch and check progress for mistakes. MaximUltimatum, mrkwanza, and thayeryates should make at least one major commit per week. A list of projects until done will be kept on the Readme.

Edit by Gabe: I'm going to insist that new features are worked on in new branches, so that we don't screw up the last stable copy. Then when the change is ready to be considered stable, merge it by making a pull request.

You can also check your code vs "good practice" [here](https://codeclimate.com/github/MaximUltimatum/ColdLogicRespiratory2016).
